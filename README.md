# Roomify - A Hotel Booking Web Application

Roomify is a full-stack web application for booking hotels. This repository contains the client part of the application, while the backend part can be found in the [booking-server repository](https://github.com/Deynao1996/booking-server).

Explore Roomify, a feature-rich hotel booking platform with dark and light themes, registration, authentication, and additional features such as Google and GitHub authentication, as well as a "forgot password" functionality. It allows users to find hotels, locations, sort prices, and make online payments for their bookings using the Stripe payment system.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of Roomify: [Roomify Live Demo](https://dbvision-booking.netlify.app)


Please note that some functionality in this demo has been limited for security reasons. Additionally, hotel images and information were sourced from [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) for a realistic demo experience without any commercial goals.

It's important to know that the demo is hosted on a free hosting service, and the server may automatically go to sleep if there are no requests from the client side. In such cases, it may take 30-60 seconds for the server to wake up when you access the demo.
