## <a name="introduction">üìò Intro</a>

Roomify is a full-stack web application for booking hotels. This repository contains the client part of the application, while the backend part can be found in the [booking-server repository](https://github.com/Deynao1996/booking-server).

Iy is a booking platform with dark and light themes, registration, authentication, and additional features such as Google and GitHub authentication, as well as a "forgot password" functionality. It allows users to find hotels, locations, sort prices, and make online payments for their bookings using the Stripe payment system.

Check out the live demo of Roomify: [Roomify Live Demo](https://dbvision-booking.netlify.app)


Please note that some functionality in this demo has been limited for security reasons. Additionally, hotel images and information were sourced from [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) for a realistic demo experience without any commercial goals.

It's important to know that the demo is hosted on a free hosting service, and the server may automatically go to sleep if there are no requests from the client side. In such cases, it may take 30-60 seconds for the server to wake up when you access the demo.
